For now it's just a class that does some things with Weka.
Data from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/autoweka/datasets/
Note that make amazon runs much slower than make wine.

make: compiles the thing
make clean: deletes class files
make wine: run stuff on wine data
make amazon: run stuff on amazon data
