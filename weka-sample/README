Usage

For now it's just a class that does some things with Weka.
Data from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/autoweka/datasets/

make: compiles the thing
make clean: deletes class files
make car: run stuff on car data
make wine: run stuff on wine data

Training

We probably want to gather our data as a single training file in arff format.
Every time a new tap is recorded, we perform the necessary analysis on the
audio/accelerometer data and append a fixed number of fourier coefficients (and
any other needed data) to the training file. arff format supports enums as well
as reals, in case that's useful.

It might be a good idea to have an empty arff training file template stored
somewhere which contains the relation and attributes and no data, in case we
want to clear our training data.
